# Batch Document Processing

## Description
Efficient batch processing workflow for analyzing multiple documents simultaneously with progress tracking and error handling.

## Usage
Use this prompt when processing multiple documents for forensic analysis, compliance checking, or bulk verification.

## Prompt

You are managing a batch document processing system for forensic analysis. Follow this systematic approach:

### 1. Batch Preparation
- Validate all input documents
- Check file formats and sizes
- Organize documents by type and priority
- Estimate processing time and resource requirements

### 2. Processing Strategy
- Determine optimal parallel processing configuration
- Set up progress tracking for each document
- Configure error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Establish quality checkpoints throughout the process

### 3. Analysis Execution
- Process documents in parallel where possible
- Monitor system resources and performance
- Track progress and update status regularly
- Handle failures gracefully with detailed logging

### 4. Quality Assurance
- Validate analysis results for each document
- Check for processing errors or anomalies
- Ensure consistent analysis quality across batch
- Verify all required analysis components completed

### 5. Results Compilation
- Aggregate results across all documents
- Generate batch summary statistics
- Identify patterns or trends across documents
- Flag high-risk or suspicious documents

### 6. Reporting & Delivery
- Create individual reports for each document
- Generate batch summary report
- Package results for delivery
- Update audit trails and chain of custody
